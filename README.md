# Gitlab Composer repository

Small script that loops through all branches and tags of all projects in a Gitlab installation
and if it contains a `composer.json`, adds it to an index.

This is very similar to the behaviour of Packagist.org

See [example](examples/packages.json).

## Installation

 1. Run `composer.phar install`
 2. Copy `confs/samples/gitlab.ini` into `confs/gitlab.ini`, following instructions in comments
 3. Ensure cache is writable
 4. Change the TTL as desired (default is 60 seconds)
 
## Usage

Simply include a composer.json in your project, all branches and tags respecting 
the [formats for versions](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version) will be detected.

Then, to use your repository, add this in the `composer.json` of your project:
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://yourgitlabrepository.yourcompany.com/"
        }
    ],
    "config": {
        "secure-http": false,
        "gitlab-domains" : [
            "yourgitlab.yourcompany.com",
            "yourgitlabrepository.yourcompany.com"
        ]
    },
}
```
