# Gitlab Composer Repository

Small script that loops through all branches and tags of all projects in a Gitlab installation
and if it contains a `composer.json`, adds it to an index.

This is very similar to the behaviour of Packagist.org / packagist.com

See [example](examples/packages.json).

## Requirement
 * Php
 * Apache Web Server
 * Gitlab (can be hosted on a different domain)
 
## Installation

 1. Run `composer.phar install`
 2. Copy `confs/samples/gitlab.ini` into `confs/gitlab.ini`, following instructions in comments
 3. Ensure cache is writable
 4. Change the TTL as desired (default is 60 seconds)
 
## Usage

Simply include a composer.json in your project, all branches and tags respecting 
the [formats for versions](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version) will be detected.

Then, to use your repository, add this in the `composer.json` of your project:
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://yourgitlabrepository.yourcompany.com/"
        }
    ],
    "config": {
        "gitlab-domains" : [
            "yourgitlab.yourcompany.com",
            "yourgitlabrepository.yourcompany.com"
        ]
    },
}
```

### Local Development
In case you like to develop on this software and run the service locally you may want to add 
"secure-http": false and 127.0.0.1 in the gitlab-domain section. E.g:
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://yourgitlabrepository.yourcompany.com/"
        }
    ],
    "config": {
        "secure-http": false,
        "gitlab-domains" : [
            "yourgitlab.yourcompany.com",
            "127.0.0.1"
        ]
    },
}
```



## Caveats
 * there is no frontend other then gitlab itself to manage users
 *
